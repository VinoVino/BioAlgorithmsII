# BioAlgorithmsII
## Coursera BioAlgorithms class - Coding Track
### This class served as my second introduction to Python.

The class is now broken into three separate classes on Coursera.
* Molecular Evolution (Bioinformatics IV)
* Genomic Data Science and Clustering (Bioinformatics V)
* Finding Mutations in DNA and Proteins (Bioinformatics VI)
